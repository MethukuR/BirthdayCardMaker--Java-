Final Project: Written Description
My project is to write the BirthdayCard class that generates a birthday card from a chosen picture with chosen size and text. As I explained in my Final Project Proposal, the four parts of the card (front, back, top, bottom) are separately generated and modified, then combined into two main parts: the outside and the inside of the card.
One major problem appeared during my process of completing the project: I had to find a way to combine two pictures without making them overlap. In order to resolve that problem, I used the Graphics2D and AlphaComposite classes to generate a 2D picture frame and put the two pictures in it, then show them as one picture. I applied this procedure for both the outside and the inside pictures.
However, the result is not as good as I has envisioned. Originally, I wanted to write a BirthdayCard class that included the GUIs allowing the user to put in the sizes and the text of the card. But it turned out that such a project would become too complicated for me to handle. Thus, I chose to manually put in the sizes and the text in the code. Other than that, I have no other goal that I have not accomplished.
